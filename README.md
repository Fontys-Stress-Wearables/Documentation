# Reading Guide
 ## Introduction
In this document, we discuss all documentation relevant to the Streaming Wearables and Stress Measurement Platform (SWSP) software project. This document can be used as a starting point for the next person or team who takes over the SWSP software project. In the next sections, references can be found to other documents that offer more details about the specific section.

 **[Project-Plan](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Plan/Project%20Plan.docx)** 
 **[Test-Plan](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Plan/Test%20Plan.docx)** 


## 1. Management and Control: How to Setup the Project
There are multiple documents to support the process of setting up the project. In the management and control folder, the setup document and azure credentials document can be found.


### 1.1.  Setup Document v2.0
This document contains information on how external parts of the platform have been configured
- Sonar Cloud set up.
- Azure authentication setup.
- How to create an organization within azure.
- GitHub authentication.

 **[Setup-Document](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Management%20%26%20Control/Setup%20Document.docx)** 

### 1.2. Azure Credentials
This document contains an example of the credentials that are important to keep track of while developing. Since the setup of Azure needs to be redone by whoever takes over this project, the credentials will have to be updated based on the new credentials from Azure.

 **[Azure-Credentials](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Management%20%26%20Control/Azure%20Credentials.docx)** 

## 2. Plan
In the plan folder, the project plan and test plan for the SWSP software project can be found.

### 2.1. Project Plan
The project plan describes the goal of the project, the context in which it was build and the initial situation the project was found in. It also describes methods testing strategies, methods of communication and planning.

 **[Project-Plan](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Plan/Project%20Plan.docx)** 

### 2.2. Test Plan
The test plan contains a detailed understanding of how the app will respond to different situations it encounters and all information regarding the testing phase.

 **[Test-Plan](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Plan/Test%20Plan.docx)** 

## 3. Design
In the design folder, the Software Architecture Document (SAD) can be found along with folders containing the images used in the document.

### 3.1 Software Architecture Document
The system architecture and design is explained in the following document. The software architecture document goes into details about the system architecture, entity relationships, C4 models, API endpoints and frontend design.

 **[Architecture-Document](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Design/Software%20Architecture.docx)** 
 
## 4. Analysis
In the analysis folder, the following documents can be found namely CICD Pipeline, Ethical Report and Requirements.

### 4.1. Ci/Cd Pipeline
To aid developers in the development process, several automated quality assurance processes were implemented. Below the documentation for the CICD pipeline can be found which will explain this topic in more detail.

 **[Ci/Cd](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Analysis/CICD%20Pipeline.docx)** 
### 4.2. Ethical Report
An ethical report was created to judge the impact of the project on its users and society.

 **[Ethical-Report](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Analysis/Ethical%20Report.docx)** 
### 4.3. Requirements
The requirements document contains all the requirements and user stories for the SWSP software project as well as their status done, almost completed or not done.

 **[Requirements](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Analysis/Requirements.docx)** 

## 5. Research
In order to create the platform and implement new features, research had to be done. Below the research plan can be found as well as the research done for the Wearable API and graph/charting library used to display data. The stress data collected from the Movesense wearable can also be found in this folder.

### 5.1 Research Plan
 **[Research-Plan](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Research/Research%20plan.docx)** 
### 5.2. Wearables API Research
 **[Wearables-API-Resarch](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Research/Wearables%20API%20Research.docx)**  
### 5.3. Graph Library Research
 **[Graph-Library-Research](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Research/Graph%20Library%20Research.docx)**  
 
## 6. Advice
In the advice folder, the future implementations and FHP students feedback can be found.

### 6.1. Future Implementations
The future implementations document describes both features and software (development) implementations that can be made in the future to improve the existing platform. The future implementations are merely suggestions and can be used as a guide for creating new user stories.

 **[Future-Implementations](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Advice/Future%20Implementations.docx)** 
### 6.2. FHP Students Feedback
This document contains feedback collected from Fontys Health Professionals students. The students tried out the platform and gave advice on what they would like to see from a health professionals viewpoint.

 **[FHP-Students-Feedback](https://github.com/Fontys-Stress-Wearables/Documentation/blob/main/Advice/FHP%20Students%20Feedback%20Caregiver%20Dashboard.docx)**
